4) Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
Ans: In RDBMS,table is not a file,every row is a file.
     Rows of table are not stored sequentially.
     Rows of table are scattered all over the database server hard disk.
     so,when we INSERT into a table wherever the system find the space in the      Database server hardisk it will store the row there.
     so,when we select the table,the order of row depends on the row address.
